# App Development Recruitment Task
$~$
## Make a Tasks App that stores data in sqlite database
- You can make it either in Flutter or Native Android (Use Kotlin in this case)
- Use [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite) when working with Flutter and [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) when working with Kotlin
- The time limit for the tast is 15 days and you will be judged on the basis the following parameters
    1. Contains all the required functions
    2. Design (UI + Animation)
    3. Completion Time
    4. Any extra stuff you add


$~$
## Task Requirements
1. The app should consist of 2 different screens. One should show the normal tasks and the second one should show the completed tasks of a user.
2. User should be able to create, update as well as delete a specific task
3. All the notes should be stored in phone (using sqlite) so that when the user reopens the app older tasks are also visible

## Steps to complete the task  

### Step 1: Make the basic UI
- Create 2 different screens as mentioned in requirements and a button to take user input
- When a user adds a new task that change should be visible in the screens
### Step 2: Save tasks in users phone
- You have to add sqlite support
### Step 3: Improvise the designs and add some animations
- You have to further refine the app that you have made by adding some complex animations and designs. You can search for some designs on dribble or other online webistes
##### Step 4: Here are some ideas for extra features that you can add (Optional)
- Swipeable guestures in the list for editing and deleting tasks
- Taking user input for date and time and then showing a notification at that time regarding the same
- Dark and light theme
